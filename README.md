                    Possible Routes:
                    - Base64 Encodings for images
                    - As attachments
                    - Store to cloud hostings
                        - Costly
                        - Inefficient for every response, uploads images to cloud
                            - Takes space
                * ✅ Charts as Image on NodeJS
                    * ✅ VEGA
                        - Sort of like D3
                        * ✅ Transform response data to VEGA data schematic
                        * ✅ Generate PNG from VEGA
